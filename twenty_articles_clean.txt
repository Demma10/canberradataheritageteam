[ JAPAN'S DOMINEERING

 ATTITUDE

 IT is now possible to form an

 accurate estimate of the real

 attitude and intentions of Japan. The Japanese Prime Minister, left them in 
no doubt when he said that the conversations with Brit- ish representatives in 
Tokio con- cerning Tientsin would be broken off unless Britain agreed to ac- 
cept the Japanese right to build

 a new order in the Far East. This

 is the last word in unscrupulous- ness when it is demanded that another 
nation shall assist in ag- gression.

 According to "The Times" cor- respondent in Shanghai, the Japanese military 
authorities blame the British for their failure to overcome the Chinese. These 
things are all part of the general plan intended to eliminate British power and 
influence from China, and it becomes clearer with every utterance, either of 
Ministers or Army leaders, that this and this alone governs their methods.

 The continued delay regarding a settlement of the Tientsin, dis- pute is 
another means of be- littling Britain. It is by now ob- vious that unless 
something much more drastic than repeated pro- tests is offered, Japan will 
main- tain her impudent anti-British policy. The economic blockade is within 
the capacity of Britain, and is apparently the remedy which Japan fears most. 
It seems as if the moment is near whea it

 should be applied.

,  STATE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE

 (JLAIMIXC1 there «ns no Justification I

 for the suggested removal of the embargo, the Minister for Agriculture

 (Mr.-R. Cosgrove) yesterday outlined | the efforts made by the Tasmanian 
Government to ease the restrictions In regard to grading in view of the recent 
shortage of supplies.

 The Minister said thut the Govern- ment had consistently opposed the re- 
moval of tho embargo. It had the full support of the Potato Marketing Board and 
producers' organisations In Its at- titude. He was advised that Tasmania could 
supply Its quota for the Austra- lian market, provided there was a slight 
modification In the standards. If this were done potatoes could be supplied at 
a price which would enable many more consumers to purchase than under existing 
conditions.

 After consultation with the Potato

 Marketing Hoard yesterday, lt was pointed out to the Minister for Agri- 
culture for New South Wales that, In view of the heavy rain ' after many weeks 
of drought weather, lt was ex- pected that some tubers would develop growth, 
cracks, and other slight ab- normalities calculated to affect the ap- pearance, 
rather than the quality. It was suggested that No. 2 "A" grade bo permitted to 
enter New South Wales. If so lt would have a steady- ing effect on recent 
prices.

 The Minister pointed out that while abnormally high prices were not good for 
any industry, the consuming public had, In several years in tho last decade, 
secured potatoes at considerably less than the cost of production, and the 
higher prices now ruling would recoup growers to some extent for prevlou«

 losses.

,  SOUTH AFRICA'S

 ATTITUDE

 STRANGELY must sound thc

 words of the Prime Minister of South Africa (General Hert- zog) in the cars 
of British people. Referring to the statement of Mr. Chamberlain, that the 
whole Em- pire approved of the guarantee to Poland, General Hertzog dis- agreed 
and said he doubted thc accuracy of it. Maintaining that the Dominions were not 
bound by Britain's commitments in Europe, he refused to permit a debate on 
.loreign affairs.

 Had these been the views ex-

 pressed in a hostile country, little surprise could bc felt. But com- ing 
from the head of one of the Dominions the)' have a peculiar meaning, lt is true 
that the Do- minions are not bound by Brit- ain, but it is also true that they 
depend on British strength for their existence as part of the Em- pire. 
Possibly General Hertzog

 does not like the connection and

 would prefer something different.

 Under General Hertzog's lead- ership, South Africa has deposed the British 
flag from its position, eliminated "God Save the King" as the National Anthem, 
and has constantly asserted that he re- serves the right to be neutral in any 
war affecting Britain. Neu- trality in such circumstances would seem to verge 
perilously near hostility. "He who is not with nie is against me," should 
express the opinion of the Empire in regard to General Hertzog.

,  Britain's Attitude Perfectly Loyal

 jyj^ BONNET'S eagerly-awaited

 speech in the Chamber of Deputies proved most important and covered a wide 
range. Mr. Winston Churchill (the British Conservative), listened In the 
strangers' gallery.

 Referring to Spain, M. Bonnet- slid that the part Italy «*as taking co*ild 
not be Ignored, but the arguments against Intervention remained.

 "We consider It Is for Spaniards alone to settle their own affairs," said M. 
Bonnet. "We «ill not alio«* our com- munications with North Africa to lie en- 
dangered by foreign troups in Sp-iin or from Morocco or from Spanish islands. 
When we informed our British friends o( this viewpoint they perfectly under- 
stood us. Britain's attitude has been per- fectly loyal, France has Interests 
to de- fend in Spain. We cannot allow any interference in Spain to extend to the
 point of threatening French Integrl'v. The Burgos Government has let it be 
known that it will not alio«' any foreign Po«*er to settle in the country 
(another version was that General Franco told us he «*ould not allow any 
foreign domina- tion In Spain). Britain is no less men- aced regarding Malta 
and Gibraltar

 Complete Solidarity

 "I can therefore affirm that there is complete Anglo-French solidarity on 
this question," said M. Bonnet, who added that the British Foreign Minister 
(Lord Halifax) had informed him that Britain would not accept any infringe- 
ment of Spanish territorial Integrity,

 M. Bonnet said that Britain and France would ask nothing of anyone, but 
intended to preserve their patri monies. The entente was never so

 close.

 It was directed towards peace, but in the event uf war all the forces of 
France would be placed at the disposal of Britain, and similarly all the forces 
of Britain would be placed at the disposal

 of France.

 M. Bonnet reiterated that the policy of non-intervention In Spain was 
?unchanged.

 M. Bonnet declared that the Franco British axis «-as as strong HS any in 
Europe. France «'anted to seo Britain develop her military power to the maxi- 
mum, just as Britain wished France to

 do likewise.

 Referring to the Franco-German peace declaration signed in Paris., II. 
Bonnet said it was but the first step towards pacific collaboration. War would 
be a misfortune for both nations.

 Turning to Franco-Italian relations, he recalled that during the last con- 
versations In Rome between Count Clano and M. Poncet it was agreed that the 
only differences related to Spain. Three weeks later Italy denounced the 1935 
Agreement and France replied that «he could not accept Italy's vle«'point 
because no political act on her part justllled that denunciation. The French 
Government felt that the British Government understood this viewpoint'

 perfectly.

 "France is determined to maintain the integrity of her umpire," he said "Let 
there be no ambiguity. Nobody may lay a finger on our Umpire. France will not 
permit any attempt against what has been built up by Preñen blood bravely and 
she «ill keep her in- dependence and her territories Intact.''

 Support in America

 M. Bonnet, alluding to the Far Enst, said that the Government wns deter- 
mined not to allow any attack against French interests. "We shall not admit 
that an agreement like the Treaty of "Washington can be unilaterally de- 
nounced," he said. "Engagements with the Soviet and with Poland con- tinue, and 
must be carried out In the spirit In which they were contracted.''

 With reference to Frunco-Amerlcnn relations, M. Bonnet said: "Every dny we 
feel that public opinion In the great

,  STATE TREASURER'S ATTITUDE

 .J^HE Treasurer (Mr. E. Dwyer

 Gray) expressed the hope yes- terday that the Federal Parliamen tary'Labour 
Party would not preju- dice its position by sanctioning defiance of thc law by 
any section of community, once the National Register Bill became law. Mr. 
Dwyer-Gray is one of the'represen tatives of the Federal Executive of the 
A.L.P. on the Federal Labour Advisory Committee, a meeting of which has been 
summoned for to- day at Canberra. Owing, to the short notice he received he 
will be unable to. attend.

 Mr. Dwyer-Gray said the other repre- sentatives ot the Federal Executive "t 
the Australian Labour Party on the Federal Advisory Committee were two 
representatives each from the Federal Labour Tarty and the Australasian

 Council nf Trades Unions. He had re- ceived on Wednes- day a telegram from 
Mr. D. ' L. McNa- mara, M.L.C., Ked rra 1 secretary of the A.L.I'., nsking him 
tn attend a meeting nf the Advisory Committee at Can- berra today, to dis- cuss 
the Xn tiona 1 ' Register Hill. He

 had replied that the

 notice was ton ' short, and that he

 would be linn ble lo

 attend unless the meeting was held in Welbourne nu Monday, or at Canberra on 
Tuesday. Mr. McNamara had re- plied that the mn tier was considered ur- gent 
and that the committee would meet .today. This meant lhat someone else would 
have lo take his pince on the committee tor that particular meet- ing. ; - :

 Mr. Dwyer-Cíniy said thal as far as he was concerned he had nut changed his 
views regardln;; any aspect nt pre- paredness, nnd'cnncitrred with the view 
expressed by the Tasmanian Ijtbour Conference In April that "there should he 
forthwith' Instituted n compulsory national . register for both men' and

 women, and also ot material assets to'

 asrertain the physical, material, indus- trial, and financial resources of 
the na- tion."

 "Should Be Observed"

 Differences ot opinion on such a mat- ter were natural and entirely 
legitimate, but actual breaches of the law would not be. He trusted, therefore, 
that, If thc Federal Parliament instituted nny sort of compulsory register the 
require- ments of the law would be observed by Australian democracy. Any type ot
 proposed opposition tu law, except vio- lence, was allowable In a democracy, 
but once the law-making Instru- mentalities of a democracy passed In actual 
law, they should be faithfully observed unless and until they were 
constitutionally altered.

 "I, therefore, hope that the Federal Parliamentary Labour Party will not 
prejudice its position beTore the pub- lic by approving of any defiance of the 
law by any section of the community," said Mr. Dwyer-Gray. "I would have said 
that at the Advisory Committee if I were in attendance, and conse- quently I 
have no hesitation in saying it in public, when I will not be in attendance."

 Mr. Dwyer-Gray said he could not understand the argument thal a com- pulsory 
register would facilitate thc conscription of men for mllitnry service, since 
under the Defence Act the Men- zies Government could conscript every- body in 
Australia today, following a simple proclamation that Australia was imperilled 
by Invasion.

 Threatened Action

 MELBOURNE, June 8.

 Seven delegates representing groups were appointed today by the confer once 
of Federal unions with members employed in "key" industries as a sub- committee 
to investigate ways and means of implementing tho "Industrial action" 
threatened In the event of any trades unionist being imprisoned for refusing tn 
sign the national register.

 This committee will submit a report and recommendations to the conference 
when lt assembles after the meeting of the Labour Federal Advisory Com- mittee 
at Canberra tomorrow.

,  President's Attitude

 WASHINGTON, July 1.

 Officials today disclaimed knowledge that there was any bnBis for London ru- 
mours that President Roosevelt ls will- ing to participate In a world problems 
conference, but recalled his recent mes- sages Io Herr Hitler and Signor Mus- 
solini offering to act as a "friendly in- termediary" in the settlement of Euro-
 pean differences.

 They said that should such a confer- ence be called by another Power, and 
Germany and Italy expressed willing- ness to participate, there was a prob- 
ability that the United States would Join the conference in the role President 
Roosevelt previously had outlined.

,  NATIONAL DISUNITY

 Australian Attitude

 Deplored

 The disunity amone political parties In Australia with regard to the prose- 
cution of the war was deplored by Mrs. V. Mary Parker at the annual confer- 
ence of the Australian Women's National League of Tasmania at Hobart yesterday.

 In Great Britain there was a unity of opinion among all peoples, Mrs. Parker 
said. There was only one object, and that was to win the war. In Australia, 
however, there were party factions and sniRll coteries which criticised the Gov-
 ernment and would not assist In the programme designed to bring the war to a 
successful conclusion. They were doing everything they could to hinder what wns 
being done. Women could help to Inculcate a spirit of loyalty among tho people. 
Unity wa« essential and everyone should unite to fight tue

 common enemy.

,  SERVICE PAY

 Brighton Council's

 Attitude

 "With, the object ot giving a lead to employers ot labour In the district, 
the Brighton Connell at Its meeting at Pontville yesterday decided to make up 
any deficiency In pay for a permanent roadman called up for military ser-

 vice.

 lt was reported that a man who recently was appointed a permanent roadman 
Itnd been called up for 30 days' training at Mona Vale.

 Councillor C. H. Eddington said he felt il was thc duty ot the council to 
give a lead to employers of labour in the municipality. He moved: -

 The council pay any difference in thc salary ot Its permanent roadman dur- 
ing the 311 days he is called up for military service.

 Councillor B. C. '1'honipsou seconded and the motion was agreed to.

,  "NO CHANGE IN ATTITUDE"

 THE Finnish Foreign Minister, in a

 statement on Friday, said that Finland's attitude to the Russian pro- posals 
remained unchanged. "They would be offensive to us in peace time," he said. "We 
have accepted about two-thirds of them, but there is a limit to everything.

 "They have asked for a cession of land north from Leningrad, islands in the 
Gulf of Finland, and the lease of land on the southern coast for a mili- tary 
base."  

 He denied that other nations had in- fluenced Finland and said that Rus- sia 
must overcome her suspicions. Finland took her stand independently.

 In a broadcast, the Prime Minister made it plain that Finland could not make 
concessions inconsistent with her integrity and independence. He said he 
understood to a certain degree Rus- sia's desire to protect Leningrad, but 
added that the Soviet proposal to es- tablish a naval base in the Gulf of Fin- 
land was incompatible with Finland's sovereignty and neutrality.

 The Prime Minister added that Fin- land would defend herself if invaded.

 Sweden Attacked  

 Sweden is attacked in the semi- official Soviet paper "Pravda" "for 
supporting Finland," says a Moscow message. "Pravda" asserts that Swedish 
politicians are "under the orders of Destern bosses," and adds:

 "Russia must ensure the sea and land approaches to Leningrad, whose 
population is equal to that of Finland.

 "The position of the Finnish Foreign Minister (M. Erkko) is similar to that 
of the former Polish Foreign Minister (Col. Beck), when he provoked war with 
Germany.

 "Russia will cast to the devil all

 political gamblers' games, and tread her own path, despite everything, 
smashing every obstacle on the way to her goal."

 It is reported in diplomatic circles that Madame Kollontal, the Russian 
Ambassador to Sweden, flew to Mos-

 cow last week at M. Stalin's request in order to apprise him of the 
situation in Scandinavia. She urged him not to antagonise Sweden and Norway in 
the Finnish negotiations.

 It is believed that if Finland makes a stand, supported by Scan- dinavia, M. 
Stalin, rather than re- veal Russia's weakness will prefer a compromise to war, 
but if Finland weakens and Scandinavia adopts an indeterminate attitude, Russia 
may suddenly move.

 Madame Tabouis, whose assertions must be accepted with reserve, sup- ports 
this testimony to the extent of declaring that M. Stalin's new slogan is: "Keep 
out of Finland at all costs and come to terms with her."

 NEW YORK, November 5.

 The position of neutrals in northern and south-eastern Europe is reviewed by 
the editor of the Paris "Soir" in a despatch to the "New York Times." He says:

 "The small neutrals can do little be- cause of their weakness.

 "Among the Scandinavian nations, only Finland has the resources to en- able 
a guerilla war to be carried on against a Russian invasion, but she would be 
unable to save the coastal cities.

 "Diplomacy no longer has much to say. Scandinavia, and Britain and France 
can do little until Norway or Sweden are directly threatened and call for help, 
which is unlikely.

 "Should Finland be attacked, which I do not expect, it would unfortunately 
be doomed and its resurrection must await the final peace."

 Press Hostility

 Mr. G. E. R. Gedye, the "New York Times" correspondent in Moscow, says it is 
undeniable that the Soviet Press makes the Russo-Finnish situation very grave.

 "The present display of hostility to Finland is due to Soviet annoyance at 
indications of foreign sympathy and support, and it is doubtless desired to 
reduce the Finns to a proper humble- ness," Mr. Gedye continues.

 "The first warning in M. Molotov's speech failed to shake Finland's de-

 termination; the second is given in 'Pravda's' article, which may imply a 
threat of military action, but is more likely to be intended to fright- en the 
Swedes from supporting the Finns, thus destroying Scandinavian unity, and may 
presage a war of

 nerves.

 "Immediate developments depend on the Swedish reaction to Russia's open 
hostility."

 ROME, November 5.  

 It is reported in Rome that 80,000 Soviet troops have moved to Karelian, on 
the Finnish-Soviet frontier.

 BERLIN, November 5.

 The Wilhelmstrasse expresses com- plete disinterest in the Finnish-Soviet 
talks, "because the Finns are not pure- ly Aryan."

 It is expected that Russian troops will cross the Finnish frontier in the 
next few days, hoping that a limited advance will compel the Finns to yield to 
all the Soviet demands.

 The Lord Mavor welcoming tedeial MInl"=tois said that Tasmania had re celved 
mote tonsldeiatlon in regard to hei affaits during the term of the pre- sent 
Govelnment than under anv pre

 vious Goveinment One of the States chief difficulties was Its balance of 
trade which was vltilh assnrlated with the tariff It wns often snid that the 
tailft affected each State alike but the dlffl cullies of adjustment were verv 
com ple\ In icgard to the smallei States He thought it was time thev got down to
 something definite instead oT having statements of that kind made Tour veais 
ago with the assistance of o. statistician he had examined the pt ob

 lern very closely, and had found that only one-third of Tasmania's exports 
benefited under the tariff. On the other nandi Du-per cent of the State's 
imports caine from the Mainland, and a large

 proportion of those goods were protect-

 ed.

 It was not very difficult to see that the State was labouring under a con- 
dition in which it was purchasing most of its imports from a sheltered coun- 
try and paying the highest prices for commodities, whereas a large propor- tion 
of its exports was sold in the open market, where the tariff waa not bene- 
ficial. During the past five year« the State's adverse trade balance had been 
more than £1,000,000.

 Training Facilities

 Speaking of defence matters,. Mr. Soundy said that a committee formed at the 
request of the Minister for Ex- ternal Affairs (Mr. Hughes) had been 
functioning for several weeks, and substantial gains had been made In re- gard 
to recruiting for the militia. He could say bluntly, however, that many young 
men did not like the Idea of forming fours and routine drill of that nature. - 
Tasmania had young men of personality and initiative nnd wished to be in "a 
position to train them for useful defence work. The State need- ed a unit of 
the Flying Corps for the training of young pilots. The only ma- chine available 
was nn old Moth which, he was. told, would crash if a power dive were attempted.

 Mr. .Soundy mentioned that during the first week of the recruiting cam- 
paign in Tasmania l-'fi young men had enlisted, and during the second week the 
number was 195. Another S07 were required to make up the State's quota.

 Mr. O'Keefe said that he and Mr. \V. M. Hughes were the only members of the 
Federal Parliament still In active politics. He recalled Mr. Hughes' ac- tivity 
during the tense struggle from which the present tariff of Australia emerged. 
He, hoped that the difflcul I ties of the smaller States would be

 gradually removed.

,  RIDERS ADAMANT IN ATTITUDE ;

 Tho programme hat] been approved by the League ot Tasmanian Wheel- men, said 
Mr. Wright, and entry fees were advertised when the programme «.ns drawn up, so 
that competitors were aware of tho cost. Tho Wheel Rneo waa worth £40, the 
scratch race £20. and the nillo handicap £10, and tho nomination fee for 
the'programme was £1/4/.

 Shortly beforo the timo for tho be- ginning of tho carnival about 30 inter- 
state entrants met outside the ground They claimed that the charge was 
exorbitant, and Bought admission for 10/. Pleadings from officers were ot no 
avail, and 20 minutes after tho ad- vertised starting time the men were

 Informed they could compote for £1,'

 but they were adamant.

 Tho programme was rearranged, nnd practically all of tho-, visiting wheelmen 
left the vicinity. , Instead of each of tho two handicap events being run in 
six hoats, they were limited to two, and 17 Tasmanians took part.

 Explaining tho position over ampli- fiers, the president said the Mainland 
entrants had stated they would not start unless a big reduction In entry feos 
was allowed. "Tasmanian riders paid thoir fees, and we took the stand that 
interstate riders should do the same," he said.

 The names of 40 Mainland cyclists appeared In the programme, but sev- eral 
did not make tho trip to West- bury.

 V. JJ. Redpath, of Sassafras, who won tho Latrobe Wheel Race the previous 
day for the third time, an- nexed the wheel race from scratch from his 
co-marker, E. G. Moore, and Mooro was successful In the scratch race. The gate 
receipts were £53.

,  ATTITUDE OF HUON COUNCIL

 rPHE Commission comprises Messrs. 1 G. D. Balsille (chairman). B. E.

 Saunders. L. T Barwick and D Mc Lennan. i

 George Courtney Frankcomb, Warden of Huon, said Huon had a population of 
5,300, a Government capital value of £1,041,147 and an annual value of £45,800. 
Rates levied were £6,150, and the annual revenue was £8,000, excluding loans. 
The Council favoured the adoption of a Joint roll for State and municipal 
rates, supported the re- tention of health services, control of court work and 
the existing system of voting. The Council considered that If the services of 
the Crown Law Depart- ment were made available to Councils it would tend 
towards Improved co- operation between local authorities and Government 
departments. He opposed amalgamation in the Huon where there was marked progress
 despite th« depressed state oi the fruit Industry. The Cojncll found difficulty
 In striking annual values of property on 3 per cent of the capital value.

 The Government roll was in a shocking condition. Soma persons whose names 
were on the roll had been dead for 10 years.

 If a joint roll were devised, assess- ments would be simplified,, "During my 
term of 15 years as a councillor, I have found nothing In the Local Government 
Act which tends to hamper the efficiency and smooth working of local govern- 
ment." said witness.

 The chairman: Have you considered a reduction of councillors?

 Witness: We are opposed to it. be- cause we consider It Is a departure from 
the fundamental principles of local government. ., ¡

 Are three members for each ward too many?-No, I find such representa- tion 
in a scattered municipality Is bene- ficial.

 Is there any reason why you should not pool road rates?-Personally, 1 
consider that would be wise.

 What Is your road revenue?-£3,000 on the last assessment.

 How did you purchase your plant?

 From loan funds.

 Are your roads In good order?-Yes. although the Ranelagh and North Huon 
roads, which carry heavy timber traffic, causo concern.

 Is road construction work, for which you obtained £4,000 a year for some 
time, still necessary?-No, hut we have the by-road problem which really

 means reconstruction.

 Have you a timber toll?-No.

 Why?-It Is difficult to Impose The timber carted is mainly case material for 
fruitgrowers.

 Witness said small mills were as- sessed at £50, and large ones at £100.

 The chairman: Is that a blind stab? Witness: It Is what the Council con- 
siders fair.

 Mr. Saunders: Do you consider the assessment of councillors' properties hy 
councillors Is right?

 Witness: Tes.

 The chairman: Do you not think It Is rather Invidious?

 Witness: Not at all.

 Mr. Saunders: We have evidence In- dicating that some counclllbrs over 
assess their properties, and others un der-assess them. ^

 Property Assessment

 Witness: I am perfectly satisfied that Huon councillors can assess pro- 
perties better than any independent valuer. We threw £100 away by employing a 
Government man. When he completed the work the roll waa in a worse state than 
ever.

 He considered orchard properties at Esperance und Cygnet were valued too

 high in view of the position of the In- I

 dustry.

 The chairman: Esperance and Cygnet are slightly below the State average.

 Witness: But no industry has had the setbacks that orcharding has had.

 Who do you suggest should compile the Joint roll?-The Government should 
arrive at the capital values.

 That means ti., duty of valuing would devolve on the State?-Yes. Capital 
values would 1 e put on a proper foot- ing, which Is most desirable.

 So that, although, in your opinion, councillors are competent to assess 
properties, the roll should be devised by the Government?-We ara bound to go by 
the Government capital

 valuation roll.

 Does the Huon Municipal Association deal with local government matters?

 Yes.

 It occurred to me that the forma- tion of these bodies is an indication of a 
realisation of some municipal diffi-

 culties.

 Mr. McLennan: Has your health In spectir full qualifications?

 Witness: No, but he is competent.

 Mr. Barwick: Are you In favour ol centralised health services?

 Witness: No. From what I nave heard about the Government medical schemes at 
Kingborough and Esperance I have no desire to have a Government doctor 
installed In the Huon.

 The chairman: How is the State high- way scheme functioning?

 Witness: Excellently.

 Charles Whlteford Elliston, Huon councillor, said road rates should be 
pooled, and the ward system should be abolished. The even representation was 
Its only strong point. The existing system of plural voting wus Inequitable. 
Voting should be baned on annual values, and In the case of owners and 
occupiers, it should be divided.

 Mr Barwick: Would two members for each ward create more efficiency?

 Witness: No.

 .'John Upchurch, Huon councillor, said ratepayers should be considered before
 any amalgamation was effected.

 Richard Horace Russell Thompson orchardift, said that considering the 
importance, progress, and efficiency of councils In the Huon district, amalgam- 
ation wa« not warranted. Huon coun- cillors were competent and the road 
overseer efficient. There was room foi Improvement in the roll.

 William Robert Yeates, Journalist said he had been reporting council meet- 
ings In the Huon for 20 years "In my opinion," he said, "rating is lax, as there
 is no uniform system. It should be based on the production capacity ol orchard 
, properties. Some orchard* producing 4,000 cases of fruit pay double the rates 
paid by orchards of the same producing capacity. I do not think you could 
amalgamate Huon and Esperance on the score of economy."

 James Hall Mason, orchardlst, ad- vocated the evolution of a system ol 
assessment on the amount of produc-

 tion.

 The chairman: Are you a valuer?

 Witness: No, but 1 take a great In

 tereat In costing.

 Claude Vivian Davey, Huon Counct Clerk, said there were 40 separate ac- 
counts Including six separate vvatei schemes. He had suggested th< grouping of 
some accounts, but th< Audit Department had opposed It.

 The chairman: Could you consolidât« hall and recreation ground rates ef- 
fectively?

 - Witness: From an admlnlstratlor viewpoint It would be advantageous but I 
doubt If it would be fair to th< ratepayers.

 Outstanding rates had been reducec from £1,200 to £700 In two years.

,  COUNCIL'S ATTITUDE TO McELWEE

 jyjlt. MALL'road the minutes of tho

 ; council meeting ut which Mc Klwee's position was discussed after he lind 
given evidence before the Royal Commission, and said lt was apparent that,- if 
the council could have dealt with him for giving evidence, it would have done 
HO.

 Mr. Ockerby said they must be care- ful, Isald Mr. Hall, and Mr. Hrowne thut 
McElwee was not dealt with drastic- ally enough last time. Tl.e council 
realised thut it made a mistuke in V)34 in not giving McElwee a chance ot. say- 
ing something. Why should Mr. Wyett call McElwee In to sec him'.' The posi- 
tion had been considered on February 20, nnd lt has been said that the coun- 
cil had made up its mind that there was only one course to follow, and thal 
McElwee must go. If that is so,.why should Mr. Wyett get Into touch with him? 
The commission will have, to consider the whole position. . You are not bound 
to Bay that, simply because no direct statements have been made, that Mr. Wyett 
knew the commission was sitting, or that McElwee was dis- missed for giving 
evidence before it . that these facts have not been proved.

 McElwee said ho made nu secret of the fact, and some are only too willing to 
go to tho inner circle with the Infor-

 mation. The commission cannot inflict, any penalty, except to report'Its 
find- ings to the proper tiuarlcrs. .

 "That would be on!y one thing to lead to a recommendation for a change in 
ths form of local govern-

 ment." . ...

 He said lie felt that'the provision In the Act stipulating seven members bf 
a'firm before'a man could hold, the position bf alderman referred to public 
companies. The position might .be thought serious enough to recommend a change 
ot-government, or only n

 tightening of the law. The position ns j regarded.the appointment of 
relatives: lo the council seemed to have been rec- tified largely, and thu 
mutters-of the lighting profit transfers, and the reap- pointment of a.night 
watchman ealled for little comment.

 However, the purchase of ^'night's foundry might lead the comm.-fsiun to ' 
consider a change in the form of gov-r ' ernment, or of the law. The purchase

 of this site for tho tramway sheds seemed to have been curried through with 
Indecent haste. It appeared that nt a meeting of the Tramway Commit- tee nn 
alderman mentioned that Knight's foundry was for sale. That alderman happened 
to be nn olllcer em- ployed by the person who held a mort- gage on the, 
property. Only a week elapsed between the time this fact was

 brought up and the decision ofthe com- mittee to spend £4,'i0(l of the 
ratepay- ers' money on acquiring the site. There did not seem to have been an 
nttempt to see another site, except for one at the corner of Bourke, and 
Paterson streets. Afr. Strike had submitted a report, but this could be 
described as negligible.

 As regards the Bourke and Paterson streets site, lt seemed obylpua that an 
alderman had taken advantage ? of knowledge acquired . In the council to get 
the man who Was his partner, but who purported to trade under another name, to 
enter into negotiations for the land. . ? '? \

 Air. Green: Under Instructions from the council. . , , ?

 Air. Hall: 1 say lt was done by the then Alayor.

 Air. Green: You said he used-his knowledge. The matter was done quite 
openly; and not In an underhand way as

 you suggest.

 "End Of Tether"

 ' "Mention has been made of rates which was owing at one stage." said Air. 
AfcElwee. "I had just about reach- ed; the end of my financial tether. Con- 
sequently, I was unable to be represent- ed at this inquiry, much to thc detri- 
ment of my case. My agreement with the council was made by negotiation, and 
surely lt might have been altered by negotiation either with myself or the head 
of ray department? The council's action-towards me ls totally unprece- dented. 
Aluch of my Information re- garding t)ie council was volunteered to me by 
Alderman Bridgborn.' When he comes before this commission, how- ever, he cannot 
remember."

 Referring, to his allegations that he had- seen Aldermen von Bibra, Boat 
wrlsht, and Browne going Into the building where Air. Wyett's office was, lie 
said that lie had no doubt that they hud gone In there. These four men could 
depend on the support of Alder- man Ockerby, which would give them a majority 
In the council. At the time lils position had been abolished and his salary 
reduced. Air. Strike's salary had been- Increased, and no other officer's pay 
hud been reduced. No policy of eco- nomy could be accepted unless lt ap- plied 
to the whole staff.

 ."I' find it difficult to believe that the aldermen were not misled, or neted
 under pressure of some kind," he said. "Thc result of this inquiry is that I am
 more than ever convinced that, had I not- given broadcast speeches, or been 
mixed up with politics, my position would not have been abolished.

 "It ls tile right of every British sub- ject to advocate the views he holds 
to be correct. Therefore. I say that the council penalised nie for taking my 
citi- zen rights, and the rights of another organisation. I claim that 1 was a 
loyal servant of the citizens of Laun- ceston In my long service In the council.
 I claim equally that the aldermen have not been so. I would suggest that con- 
sideration be given by the commission to the possibility of pressure being 
brought to bear on the council."

 ]\JR. SHIELDS explained that he pro-

 posed to deal with three sections of the inquiry. They were the alleged 
attempt to prevent McElwee from giv- ing evidence before the commission, 
McElwee's dismissal, and the purchase of Knight's foundry for the tramway

 depot.

 He pointed out that, if the allegation of an attempt to prevent McElwee giv- 
ing evidence were established, it would be a very serious matter, but taking 
the evidence and the explanations of- fered, the commission could only come to 
the conclusion that the charge was not well founded. It was the general 
impression throughout Tasmania that the commission was set up td inquire Into 
local government, particularly as to-any amalgamations that might be possible, 
and as to any reduction of overhead expenses, but he did not think aldermen had 
any idea that the commission intended to inquire into the affairs of the 
Launceston City Council, or ot the Hobart City Coun- cil. There was no doubt 
that on tho Monday before McElwee gave his evi- dence his position as an 
officer of the council was under consideration by the corporation.

 VI submit with confidence that you can accept the sworn evidence of Al- 
derman A. E. "Wj-ett, and -the other aldermen who appeared hore, that they had 
no knowledge that this Royal Commission was taking ' evidence In Launceston on 
that Friday morning McElwee appeared before, it," Mr. Shields continued. 
"Before you can say that even- Mr. Wyott or tho coun- cil attempted to do 
anything to pre- vent McElwee giving' evidence you have got to have more than 
mere sus- picion. -You have got to have it estab- lished almost to a degree of 
certainty."

 "Was Unbalanced"

 Mr, Shields contended that from 1934 on, as far as the abolition of his 
position waa concerned, McElwee was unbalanced. The whole thing had be- come 
such an obsession with him that it overshadowed his reason. "I submit that as 
far as this first charge is con-

 cerned." hn added, "there ls nothlnir tc

 support'it, and. no evidence that would justify you in coming to the 
conclusion "that Mr. Wyelt or any other alderman had been.Milty ot such a 
serious and grave offence us this."

 Dealing with the question of McEl-. wee's dismissal this year, Mr. Shields 
said that; if McElwee were victimised by. being summarily dismissed because 
of'the evidence he gave to the commis- sion, it would be a serious matter as far
 as: the corporation was concerned. The question which the-commission had to 
consider was whether or not McElwee was dismissed because lie gave that

 evidence.

 Mr. Shields reviewed the evidence on this point In detail. He said that in 
,1934 seven out of hine aldermen agreed lo the abolition of McElwee's position, 
and the other two objected to the method of procedure. "What was it that caused 
seven aldermen to agree ; that the office should be abolished?" asked Mr. 
Shields. "Why has not tho same thing occurred to some other officer ot the 
corporation? Why should lt happen to McElwee and to no one else? In that regard 
thc evidence given this morning by Mr. Green is most im- portant. . lt shows 
the state of affuirs existing ns far as McElwee was con- cerned as far back as 
seven years prior to the aboiltlon of his office. I am go- ing to tell you why 
that office was abol- ished. McElwee, for some time prior to 1934, had created 
a situa- tion that made lt impossible for him to continue In his then position. 
It I may venture to say so, if the aldermen made a mistake in 1934, it was not 
in abolishing tho posi- tion, but in not dismissing McElwee from the service. 
Obviously, thc posi- tion could arise that a man might be entirely satisfactory 
on the technical side, but ns far as his general behaviour and demeanour were 
concerned, he could bc such a nuisance that ulti- mately lt would lead to his 
dismissal. That I submit is what happened here."

 j Remained Employee

 If charges had been brought against McElwee, the¿ difficulty would have been 
to'obtain'witnesses to come for- ward, despite the frequent complaints which 
were pouring ,in. In 1934, seven of the nine aldermen - voted for the abolition 
of McElwee's position, and the other two disagreed only on the procedure 
adopted. Yet between 1934 and 1938, at least one ot those aldermen did all he 
could to have McElwee rein- stated and, when the higher position became vacant, 
the voting was only five to four In favour of McElwee. This did not indicate 
continued animosity towards McElwee.

 "Where charges are being mado against a man," he said, "I agree that the. 
accusers should be brought before thc accused to make their allegations.) Hut 
not in all cases. And this was one of those. There are cases which crop up and 
must crop up where It is absolutely imperative that the individ- ual must go. A 
man may create a position which makes lt imposible for him to continue in 
employment, especi- ally in the case of councils where al- dermen or 
councillors are answerable to ratepayers.

 "McElwee became obsessed with the injustice he considered he had suffer- ed, 
and lost all sense of balance. After his. position had been abolished, he made 
a statement at a public meeting that one alderman, was a coward, who shot from 
behind a hedge, and was one man on Sundays and something differ- ent on week 
davs. iinw iT» >i-m,u

 you, Mr. Chairman, retain an employee In your department If you had had a 
dispute, and he went away and said something similar? Yet McElwee stays In the 
employ of the council for five

 years after this.

 "I have lost much respect for the aldermen since I have heard' these things 
brought before the commission to think that they have put up with the position. 
How many people would have tolerated it? How can anything work 'without some 
loyalty? Some- times you get to a position where either, the employer' or 
employee must go, and the employee always mud, for the employer cannot.

 "On this particular question Mc- Elwee. waj. not sane. This ls a common 
experience. In the end every alderman turned against him. Is not that sig-

 nificant?" .

 Mr. Shields said he would not attempt - to argue whether the' letter to the 
Masonic Lodge should have been brought.before the council, but once it was put 
before lt, aldermen had no option but to take action. McElwee said he signed 
the apology, knowing it to be wrong, but because he was afraid of losing his 
Job. Yet he re- mained in the employment of the council another year before the 
matter was brought up again, when a letter was written to the Masonic fraternity
 alleging that a conspiracy had been hatched by Bro.. Wyctt In the presence ot 
Messrs. Browne, Boatwrlght, and

 von Bibra,

 .'The truth ls that, when McElwee signed that apology, he meant lt," con- 
tinued. Mr. Shields, "but the festering Bore was there, and came to the sur 
Tace again. He was still In the employ ot nw council when he gave evidence 
before the Boyal Commission. He did not hand in his resignation before, and say 
he was going to say what be had been afraid to cay for four years.

 No Haste

 Mr. Shields said he was astounded when Mr. Hall had referred to undue haste 
in the purchasi ot Knight's foundry for the new tramway sheds. Mr. Strike had 
stated that there was no other site suitable on the trams routes. The truth was 
that the coun- cil realised that thc sooner it closed with the deal the better.

 "Is my friend suggesting that there was some rake-off to be divided by all 
the council?" he said. "Is there some- thing wrong or sinister with the trans- 
action? Why did not my friend have the courage to come out into thc open with 
his allegation? Would nine alder- men sit round a table and plan a rake-off of 
that nature?"

 Mr. Hall: It never entered my mind. Mr. Shields: The Implication against the 
late Mr. George Shields in this matter was an absolute slander against the 
memory of a dead man, anil was calculated to bring other aldermen Into 
disrepute. Only one Interpretation could be placed on the insinuations.

 Mr. Hall: Who made the Insinua- tions?

 Mr. Shields: You did. The chair

 (Continued in Next Column)

 (Continued from Preceding Column)

 man agreed with me that such an Im- plication was Inferred.

 Collection Of 'Accounts

 Mr. Green dealt with the associa- tion of the former Mayor (Mr. A. E. Wyett) 
with the collection of muni- cipal accounts .byr.Tasmanian Collec- tion 
Service: (Launceston) Pty. Ltd. He pointed out that' Mr. Wyett, although he had 
oi>ly half done the Job of resigning as a director of this com- pany, had 
continued In good faith, and lt was only when he received a sub- poena to 
attend the commission that he found out he had forgotten to carry .out his 
intention of resigning, ; It was

 then he resigned.

 A« far as Alderman E. Boatwrlgl'.t's association with the Kingswear Manu- 
facturing Co. Pty. Ltd. was concerned. Mr. Green contended his position had 
never been doubtful, as far ns the law stood. Once Mr. Boatwright hail re- 
signed as a director, the company would have been quite within its rights and 
within the law in contracting with the council. Mr: Green contended also that 
there had been nothing irregular In the way In which the City Council had 
purchased land at the corner of

 Bourke and Paterson streets.

 The chairman eaid the Inquiry was concluded as far as the Launceston City 
Council was concerned.

,  India Congress

 Attitude

 ALLAHABAD, October 1. ;

 Pandit Nehru, president ot the All India Congress,, told the University 
Union that If the speech In the House of Lords on-Tuesday by the Secretary 
lorMndla (Lord Zetland) represented the mind . of the British Government and 
people, there could be no , com- promise between the AU-Indla Con- gress and 
Britain, "now or 1,000 years hence.".

 A resolution adopted recently by the Congress said indian sympathy was 
entirely on the side of democracy and freedom, but it could not associate 
itself with the present war while free- dom was denied India.

 When Mahatma Gandhi, former Con- gress leader, and Jinnah, of the Con- gress 
executive, conferred at Simla with the "Viceroy (the Marquess of Linlith- gow) 
this week. It was believed that they discussed Britain's war aims and future 
attitude to India.

,  FOREIGN MIGRANTS i

 Attitude Of Victoria

 League

 The Victoria League in Tasmania has advised.the league headquarters in 
London that it. will welcome foreign migrants provided their credentials nre in 
order. .This was .announced . at a meeting of, the Tasmanian organisa- tion at 
Hobart yesterday, when Lady Clark presided.

 The secretary (Hrs. C D. Cuthbert) reported that Tasmania's attitude to 
foreign migrants had been outlined In a letter to headquarters in reply to a 
question for Information on the sub- ject. The league's first task, she said, 
was to strengthen the ties that bound Tasmania to the Motherland, but it was 
realised that as a result of in- creased employment in armament pro-; ductlön . 
In ' Great Britain there was little likelihood of a resumption of British 
migration to Australia until world'sanity was restored.

 Mrs. Cuthbert also referred to the move to establish branches of the league 
in British possessions in the Pacific, to the holding of the flrst of a series 
of social gatherings under

 leugne uusplces iii Hobart, as well as

 to other gatherings atwhich visitors to Hobart had been welcomed. The 
udvantage gained by Tasmanian stud-, ents overseas hi linking up with the 
leugne was stressed. The school cor- respondence súbeme continued one of the 
league's most important activities, and In this connection appreciation to the 
THO inul. îllï studio managements was expresseil. The branch was join- ing with 
others throughput the Bm pire In -sending greetings to Lady Jer- sey un the 
occasion of her 90th birth- day.

 M ISM Sheila Parsons, for the league's Voling Contingent, reported that par- 
cels of books had been sent to bush nui'sing centres and to King Island and 30 
State schools. .

 The secretary for schools correspon- dence (Miss Mary Watchorn) reported 
(hat an average of 50 letters a month had been sent out and that stamp.col- 
lecting, wlth a.view to knowledge of the llmpire,, was being encouraged.

,  SUPPORT GIVEN ,

 Commissions Attitude

 To Competitions

 The last two concerts of the Laun- ceston competitions are broadcast, and 
the Australian Broadcasting Commis- sion pays a substantial fee for the right, 
said Mr. C. C. Wicks, Tasmanian man- ager of the commission at Hobart, yes- 
terday. He was commenting on state- ments at the annual meeting of the 
.Launceston Competitions Association

 in which the hope was expressed that the commission would give more sup- 
port to the association, and In which it was suggested that Tasmanian per- 
formers should have more opportunity to broadcast.

 Mr. Wicks said the commission gave many opportunities to Launceston per- 
formers, and Launceston was treated better in that respect than any other, city 
of similar size. At the same time, the commission had to give balanced 
entertainment, and representations had been made for the transmission to Tas- 
mania of more Items on Mainland national programmes. In the circum- stances, 
the commission did its best for Launceston, and lt felt it could not use 
Launceston performers to any greater, extent, because, with the exception of 
the Railway Silver Band, most of those available were vocalists, and , that 
narowed the scope.

,  AMALGAMATION

 OPPOSED

 Attitude Of Waratah

 After giving consideration to the proposed amalgamation of municipali- ties, 
the Waratah Municipal Council unanimously agreed to the following

 motion:

 "As the conditions and needs pecu- liar to the district have been well 
served by the present form of local control for the past 30 years, the Council 
strongly objects to the pro- posal to attach Waratah to Table Cape or any other 
municipality, un- less It can be clearly shown that services at least equal to 
the present services can be provided without any increase in rates.

 "This Council is of opinion that. If the Public Works Department and other 
central departments appointed more professional inspectors, and provided more 
rigid supervision, in a similar manner to the Audit Depart- ment, a minimum 
standard of effi- ciency to suit the variety of condi- tions and needs of the 
municipalities could be attained."

 It wae decided to hold a special meeting of the Council to prepare evi- 
dence for submission to the Royal Commission on Local Government

 Opposition At Rou
